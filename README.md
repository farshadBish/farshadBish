I am Farshad Bishomar. a Front-end Web Developer working mostly with ReactJs.

I enjoy working with reactJs and some spice of Bootstrap with it and sometimes if needed work with TypeScript and Redux.

I am self educated with online courses about programming and Front-end web developping.
and I learned about these frameworks and React in 2021-2022.
